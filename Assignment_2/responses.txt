1. Directories are the path for files and the nesting of its folders. Directories are related to files because files are structered through directories and you must navigate a directory in order to reach a file.

2. VCS, or version control systems, are useful because you can use them as a way to remember all the changes you have made.

3. My favorite artistic medium would have to be painting because it is a fun and relaxing activity.
