Using the Wayback Machine, I visited the IMBD website from October 21st, 2013.
When comparing IMBD's website now compared to the 2013 version that I visited, I noticed a sleeker design on the current version that was easier to navigate and flowed more smoothly. I also noticed that they changed their color scheme to be a little bit darker and I find the current version to be much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It was quite funny and interesting to see what was trending on IMBD in 2013 as well!
